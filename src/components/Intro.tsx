              Hi, I’m Priyanshu Kumar Sinha, a passionate full-stack developer from India, currently studying at Dayananda Sagar College of Engineering. I enjoy diving deep into the fundamentals of computer science, and I’m currently building my own CPU through the nand2tetris tutorial.

                When I’m not coding, I’m sharing knowledge with peers, leading initiatives, or exploring new ideas that spark creativity and growth.
